# C programming:-
------

- C language is one of the most popular and most used compiled high-level programming language.

- C programming language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in year 1972 in Bell laboratory for creating system application that directly interacts with the hardware such as kernels, drivers etc.



## History of  C programming language: 
----------------------------------------------------

**History of C is very interesting to know:**

* C programming language was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell laboratories of AT&T in USA.

* It was developed to overcome the problem of the old lanugages as B, BPCL,etc.

* Initially C was develop to be used in Unix operating system.

* C inherits many feature of its predecessors languages such as B and BPCL.

**Below is the table of some of the programming language developed before C**

|**Languages** | **Year** | **Developed By**           |
|--------------|----------|----------------------------|
|Algol         | 1960     | International Group        |
|BCPL          | 1967     | Martin Richard             |
|B             | 1970     | Ken Thompson               |
|Traditional C | 1972     | Dennis Ritchie             |
|K & R C       | 1978     | Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie |
|ANSI C        | 1989     | ANSI Committee             |
|ANSI/ISO C    | 1990     | ISO Committee              |
|C99           | 1999     | Standardization Committee  |




## Features of C programming :
--------------------------------

__**There are 10 important features of C programming languages**__

1. Simple

2. Portable(*Machine independent*)

3. Mid-level programming lanugage

4. Structured programming lanugage

5. Rich library

6. Memory Management

7. Fast Speed

8. Pointers

9. Recursion

10. Extensible

 **1. Simple**
 -----------------
  *C language is simple as it has easy to learn syntax, C programs can be structured(Can breaks into parts{function}),limited keywords.*

 **2. Machine independent**
 ---------------------------
  *Unlike Assembly language, C program can be run in different machines. with some specific changes in code, C program can be run in 32-bit and 64-bit or ARM-based machine.* 

 **3. Midlevel programming language**
 -------------------------------------
  *Although C language has many low-level programming features like Dynamic-memory-managment{Allocates memory in runtime(You'll be studying this in more detail later.)}, It supports feauters of high-level programming like arrays,structures,unions,etc*

 **4. Structured programming language**
 ----------------------------------------
  *C is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify. Functions also provide code reusability.*

 **5. Rich library**
 ---------------------
  *C language provides rich in-built functions that makes programming fast and effective.*

 **6. Memory Management**
 --------------------------
  *It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.*

 **7. Fast speed**
 ------------------- 
  *The compilation and execution time of C language is fast since there are lesser inbuilt functions and hence the lesser overhead.*

 **8. Pointers**

  *C provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers. We can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array, etc.*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 **9. Recursion**

## Basic C program


```C
    #include<stdio.h> //Header file
    /*Program starts with main()*/
    int main(){
        printf("Hello world"); //Prints value given in ()
    }

```
